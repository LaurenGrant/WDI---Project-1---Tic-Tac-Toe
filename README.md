# WDI---Project-1---Tic-Tac-Toe

What is it?
Basic tic tac toe style game. Two players from the same computer compete to place either "X" or "O" three times consecutively either in a row, column, or diagonal.

Technologies Used:
General Assembly WDI Instructors, Mozilla Developer Network, W3Schools Online Web Tutorials

Approach Taken:
I used a multidimensional array to represent the game board created a switch player function that allowed two users from the same computer participate in the same game.
For this game I had to solve the following problems.

- Use a click function so a player can mark the board to represent their turn.
- Create a function that allowed players to switch turns.
- Determine if a player has won or if neither player did.

For version 2.0 to be launched tbd, I want to create the ability for two people to be able to play the same game from different devices. Version 2.0 will also have enhanced CSS for a better user experience.
