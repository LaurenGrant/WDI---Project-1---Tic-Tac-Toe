          <p>It is a snowy night in Boston (shocker!) and you realize you will need to shovel out your car in the morning. Problem is so does your neighbor who makes everything into a competition. They propose a challenge of who can clear a path to their car first. Loser has to shovel out the winner's car for the rest of the winter. You accept.</p>
          <p>You both agree that to make a clear path to your car, you need to shovel out 3 square patches of snow in either a row, a column or diagonal fashion. You agree you will take turns shoveling. Whoever shovels first will place an X down in their path and the second will place an O. You agree you can block each other if you want.</p>
